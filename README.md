**Intro**

This project is a culmination of Sprints 1 through Sprint 3 of TripleTen. With the given Figma archive, the necessary specifications and images were incorporated and matched to accomodate popular display sizes for mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. Additional breakpoints were included to accomodate the change in displayed card elements.

The link to the Figma project is included below:

**Review**

Overall, this project proved a necessary challenge and valued introduction into the process of software development. I have found that much of the time given was for minute adjustments to code -- redundancies that did not have intended effects or re-examining code to see what could be done better. Certainly, more-experienced minds will recognize areas that can be adjusted or changed, and I welcome that input.

I have included a link to a video with my full assessment of this project: my methods, thought process, and more.
